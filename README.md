# ColorDemo for Android

This application is a demonstration of views, events and simple storage on the Android platform. It was used
in a course at Technical School of Engineering in Jönköping, Sweden taught by Mikael Plate. Its purpose is
also to compare these operations to how they are done on the iOS platform. Therefore, a corresponding
similar application is available for iOS at https://github.com/mikeplate/colordemo-ios.git
